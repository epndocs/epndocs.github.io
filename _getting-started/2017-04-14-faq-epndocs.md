<h1>Release Highlights</h1>
Simplify and scale your network infrastructure and make it easy to operate. Prepare the network for new business models where applications can direct network behavior. Make your network infrastructure ready for software-defined networking (SDN). Strike a balance between distributed intelligence and centralized optimization and programming. With EPN 5 you can take full advantage of all latest advances in converged transport, services, and programmability.

<h2>Converged Transport</h2>
Gain even greater transport reliability and ultimate network scale with segment-routing-enabled transport. Achieve better use of installed network infrastructure. Unblock the scale of your network with hierarchical designs. Apply it to greenfield and brownfield deployments.

<h2>Services</h2>
Converge all your services over your new enhanced infrastructure. Learn how to deploy Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPNs with optimal positioning of wireline service edge functions.

<h2>Programmability</h2>
Provision automated services using the Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) enabled by Tail-f. Program dynamic services discovery and assurance using the EPN Manager. Use controllers to enable services-based network slicing and end-to-end network integration.
